# my own personal spotify wrapped ðŸ“Š
In 2023 I had a crazy idea and wanted to _use_ (spam) the spotify API to make my own spotify wrapped at the end of the year. It was a fun process and a bit unreliable but by the end of the year I was able to gather almost 10k unique data points and didnt have to pay a single cent! The cron job was hosted on @moal-labs and polled the spotify servers every 30 seconds for a whole year (except the one week it went down and I had no idea oops)
